# Hello ðŸ‘‹. I'm Kshitij (KJ).

I am a web developer by profession. I enjoy tinkering with modern JavaScript, experimenting with open-source tools, and building self-hosted projects. I learn best by diving hands-on into projects, solving real problems. I share my learnings, discoveries and insights through my [blog](https://jain.tech).

Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jain-id).
